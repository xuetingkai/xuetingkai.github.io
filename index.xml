      <description>Being a student, I hope to learn some necessary skills that can one day be applied. Yet, sometimes I ask myself, what would I do in an unfamiliar situation? I may not have an answer to this, but after listening to others&amp;rsquo; experiences, I did gain some insights. I will share three main takeaways.
Open-Mind One thing that stood out during the engagement is that the presenters, although all engineering-trained, are all not in technical roles.</description>

      <description>I cleared this module through a two-weeks course conducted for E-Scholar students. After meeting certain criteria, I was considered to have passed this module. No letter grade was carried on to my CAP.
Content This APC course involved lectures and lab. During lectures, we learnt content regarding mechanical, electrical and software. We also learnt how basic components, such as motors and motor drivers, work. For the last few lectures, we got some experience working with Computer Aided Design (CAD) using Fusion360.</description>

      <description>I cleared this module through the Advanced Placement Test administered by the College of Humanities and Sciences (CHS). After the test, I was considered to have passed the module. No letter grade was carried on to my CAP.
Content The content tested is mostly an add-on to H2 Mathematics. Additional topics include multivariable and vector calculus. More information can be found on the CHS website.
Assessment For my year, the test was conducted on Luminus, proctored through Zoom.</description>

      <description>I have cleared this module under iBLOCS, which is a programme catered to those who have ORDed or are ORDing soon. At the end of this 6 month course, I cleared my CS1010E requirement and earned a letter grade which can be transferred over to my CAP.
Content This module taught some basic programming concepts, such as scoping, loops and functions, using mostly Python and a bit of Java.
Introduction to CS1010X &amp;amp; Basics of Python Functional Abstraction Good Abstraction and Introduction to Recursion Recursion, Iteration + Order of Growth Debugging Higher Order Function Data Abstraction Working with Sequences Searching and Sorting Multiple Representations Generic Operators Object Oriented Programming Dynamic Programming &amp;amp; Memoization, Exception Handling Introduction to Java Programming Object Oriented Programming with Java The content seems more difficult/heavy than the usual CS1010 courses, but we do have more time to learn too.</description>

      <description>Hello.
I am an undergraduate studying Mechanical Engineering (ME) at the National University of Singapore. Although I am studying ME, I am also interested in a lot of other fields, such as coding and pure Physics. I like to discuss these topics, so you can find me to have a chat.
For co-curricular, I was involved in theatre. Back in high school, I was involved in various Chinese Drama performances for 5 years.</description>
