The Prof also sometimes goes into deeper concepts. You probably do not need to learn Python before hand, but knowing some of syntax can help you get up to pace faster. Anyway, here are some key takeaways.\nThe Awakening Moment Some of the concepts (e.g. recursion) are quite abstract. I spent quite a lot of time thinking of how to solve some of the missions (assignments); some can even take up weeks. But after solving them, I think it is good to reflect on the thinking process. After a while, I got a hang of it.\nNot Exactly a Python Course The Prof did explain that this course is not a course that teaches programming in Python. Instead, Python is used to teach programming concepts. I have to agree with this. It is good to go in with a mindset that you are not learning a specific programming language as it reduces the mental barrier when trying a new language.\nUseful Outside CS Although this is a CS coded module, some of the concepts are useful outside of CS. When I took EG1311, I actually encountered some of the concepts being used to programme the Arduino. Some modules from other departments may also include plenty of coding.\nAssessment Coursemology 33% Participation 2% Midterm 16% Practical Exam 16% Finals 33% Almost everyone got the full 35% for coursemology and participation. For the exams, it is really important to understand the concepts, as the style of the problems changed from one batch before me. It is no longer the typical reading the CSV file and short problems. The questions tested more computational thinking. One of the questions does not even involve coding (I think I saw it in some Math Olympiad before). You canâ€™t do all the past year papers and expect to be able to be prepared for the exam.\nGeneral I really enjoyed this module. Having six months to study for one module also makes this module generally manageable, even when I am working part time. Learning programming through a module also lays out the concepts in a more systematic manner to be learnt. I would recommend people to take it.\nFinal Grade: A\n",
