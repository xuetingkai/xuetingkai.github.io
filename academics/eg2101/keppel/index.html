  "articleBody": "Being a student, I hope to learn some necessary skills that can one day be applied. Yet, sometimes I ask myself, what would I do in an unfamiliar situation? I may not have an answer to this, but after listening to othersâ€™ experiences, I did gain some insights. I will share three main takeaways.\nOpen-Mind One thing that stood out during the engagement is that the presenters, although all engineering-trained, are all not in technical roles. Some were previously in technical roles but transitioned to managerial roles. This made me question what I am learning. It is not so much about how many things I learn are going to be useless, but more about how many useful things am I not learning. During the tea session, I asked one of the presenters how does he know what he needs to learn. He replied that when someone asks him something and he does not know the answer to it, he will take note of it, and go find out.\nAlthough it is common sense that one will run into doubts, it felt reassuring to hear it from someone a professional. What I gained from this is the importance of an open mind to learn what I was not taught. While I am learning to be an engineer, I may not have learned what is needed in the future. In fact, I may not even work as an engineer. I hope to gain the ability to learn outside of a school setting, without the assistance of teachers.\nPassion I decided to take up an unbonded scholarship because I am not certain what do I want to do in the future, and by the time the bond ends, I am not sure whether I and willing and able to start a new career. I think this is what people call the midlife crisis.\nAt the engagement, the presenters shared how their passion led them to change or stick to their path. One of them also shared how when he believes in something, he will try his best to convince his superiors. Likewise, I hope I can find something which I can be passionate in and have the courage and grit to stick to it.\nHumility One of the presenters shared with us that being a leader means having the need to make decisions, and decisions come with mistakes. He shared how he once made a mistake, which if not resolved, can lead to a large amount of monetary loss. He decided to be honest and informed his superior on the problem and his plan to resolve the solution. Fortunately, with a stroke of luck, the problem is mitigated. During the tea session, I asked him, what would have happened if the stroke of luck did not happen? What if the problem is not mitigated? He replied that he will have to accept the mistake and face the necessary consequences.\nThis is my greatest takeaway from this engagement. I asked myself, would I have done the same in this situation? I found this difficult to answer. Firstly, I have never made a mistake that can induce so much loss. Secondly, often I know the problem can be solved. If I were to encounter a similar situation, I may not react the same way, but I hope what I gained from this engagement can act as a reference for my actions.\nConclusion Probably at some point in the future, I will have some similar experiences. Some may be unfamiliar. Some I may not have an answer to. But through this engagement, I did gain some insights which can act as guiding principles for my actions.\n",
